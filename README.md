## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+

## Deployment

This site can be deployed to GitHub Pages; the workflow includes a step to add a `CNAME` for the custom domain `nuezip.w3cub.com`.

### Manual Deployment

To deploy manually:

1. Build the site: `pnpm docs:build`
2. The built files will be in `docs/.vitepress/dist`
3. Copy any IAP pet files into the dist `pets/` directory
4. Deploy to your hosting platform or push to `gh-pages`

## IAP Pet Files

The `pets/` directory stores downloadable `.catpet` files for in-app purchase pets. These files are copied into the build during deployment so users can download purchased pets.
